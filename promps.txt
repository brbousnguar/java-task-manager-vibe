Add category, priority level, and status fields to the Task class. Use enums for priority (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT) and status (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED). Include proper validation and update constructors accordingly

Update TaskService to include methods for filtering tasks by category, priority, and status. Add methods to get tasks grouped by these criteria and to update task status specifically.
